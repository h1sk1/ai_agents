# VSYS Sidechain
```text
I'm currently working on a project to build a evm compatible side-chain for VSYS chain.
Find and compare side-chain and bridging solutions for VSYS chain.
The side-chain needs to be compatible with EVM and support smart contracts.
The side-chain can be used for commercial.
The side-chain needs to run as a private chain, cannot connect to current main/test blockchain network.
The bridging solution should be secure and efficient.
VSYS chain do not have any side-chain or bridging solution yet, so current bridging solutions will not work, we have to start from scratch.
You need to study how VSYS chain works, including consensus, block generation, transaction processing, etc. from online resources and your own research.
You need to study current evm compatible blockchain, including consensus, block generation, transaction processing, etc. which can be used as a side-chain, and can be used for commercial from online resources and your own research.
You need to study how bridging solution works, including cross-chain communication, asset transfer, etc. from online resources and your own research.
My final goal is tweaking VSYS chain and creating a bridge to a currently existing evm compatible blockchain as a side-chain.
